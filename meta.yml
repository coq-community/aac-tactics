  Coq plugin providing tactics for rewriting universally quantified
  equations, modulo associative (and possibly commutative) operators

description: |-
  This Coq plugin provides tactics for rewriting universally quantified
  equations, modulo associativity and commutativity of some operator.
  The tactics can be applied for custom operators by registering the
  operators and their properties as type class instances. Many common
  operator instances, such as for Z binary arithmetic and booleans, are
  provided with the plugin.

  ## Documentation

  The following example shows an application of the tactics for reasoning over Z binary numbers:
  ```coq
  Require Import AAC_tactics.AAC.
  Require AAC_tactics.Instances.
  Require Import ZArith.
  
  Section ZOpp.
    Import Instances.Z.
    Variables a b c : Z.
    Hypothesis H: forall x, x + Z.opp x = 0.
  
    Goal a + b + c + Z.opp (c + a) = b.
      aac_rewrite H.
      aac_reflexivity.
    Qed.
  End ZOpp.
  ```
  
  The file [Tutorial.v](theories/Tutorial.v) provides a succinct introduction
  and more examples of how to use this plugin.
  
  The file [Instances.v](theories/Instances.v) defines several type class instances
  for frequent use-cases of this plugin, that should allow you to use it off-the-shelf.
  Namely, it contains instances for:
  
  - Peano naturals	(`Import Instances.Peano.`)
  - Z binary numbers	(`Import Instances.Z.`)
  - N binary numbers	(`Import Instances.N.`)
  - P binary numbers	(`Import Instances.P.`)
  - Rational numbers	(`Import Instances.Q.`)
  - Prop			(`Import Instances.Prop_ops.`)
  - Booleans		(`Import Instances.Bool.`)
  - Relations		(`Import Instances.Relations.`)
  - all of the above	(`Import Instances.All.`)
  
  To understand the inner workings of the tactics, please refer to
  the `.mli` files as the main source of information on each `.ml` file.
